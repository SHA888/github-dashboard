# Personal GitHub Dashboard Development Milestones

## Overview

Personal GitHub Dashboard is a hybrid application that provides GitHub data visualization and insights in both web and desktop environments. The application leverages modern web technologies for the browser-based version while offering enhanced offline capabilities and system integration through a Tauri-based desktop client.

## Architecture Milestones

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- [x] Initialize project structure
- [x] Set up basic Rust backend with Actix-web
- [x] Configure PostgreSQL and Redis
- [ ] Integrate Tauri framework for desktop capabilities
- [ ] Implement environment detection (web vs desktop)
- [ ] Set up shared React frontend structure

### Phase 2: Authentication & Data Layer

- [ ] Implement dual-mode authentication:
  - Web: Session-based auth with GitHub OAuth
  - Desktop: PAT-based auth with secure storage
- [ ] Develop unified GitHub API integration:
  - Web: Server-side API calls with Redis caching
  - Desktop: Client-side Octokit with local storage
- [ ] Create data synchronization system between modes

### Phase 3: Frontend Development

- [ ] Design and implement shared UI components:
  - Repository list and filters
  - Activity dashboards
  - Analytics visualizations
- [ ] Develop mode-specific features:
  - Web: Real-time updates and collaboration
  - Desktop: Offline mode and Logseq integration
- [ ] Implement responsive layouts for web/desktop

### Phase 4: Desktop Integration

- [ ] Implement Logseq integration:
  - Local graph storage setup
  - Note reading/writing functionality
  - Optional graph visualization
- [ ] Configure Tauri plugins:
  - Secure storage for tokens and cache
  - File system access for Logseq
  - System notifications
- [ ] Set up cross-platform builds

### Phase 5: Data Persistence

- [ ] Web Mode:
  - PostgreSQL schema and migrations
  - Redis caching layer
  - API rate limiting and optimization
- [ ] Desktop Mode:
  - Local secure storage structure
  - Offline data synchronization
  - Cache management

### Phase 6: Testing & Deployment

- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing:
  - Shared component tests
  - Web-specific backend tests
  - Desktop-specific Tauri tests
- [ ] Set up deployment pipelines:
  - Web: Server deployment workflow
  - Desktop: Cross-platform build pipeline
- [ ] Configure auto-updates for desktop client
