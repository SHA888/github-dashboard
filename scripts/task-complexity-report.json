      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement GitHub OAuth Authentication",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the authentication flow into granular backend and frontend steps, including error handling, security hardening, and user experience improvements. Consider subtasks for OAuth registration, endpoint implementation, token encryption, JWT session management, frontend integration, token refresh, security audits, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves secure integration with a third-party OAuth provider, backend and frontend coordination, token management, encryption, JWT handling, and robust error handling. The need for secure storage, refresh mechanisms, and frontend session management increases both technical and architectural complexity. The current subtasks are comprehensive but could be further split for security reviews, UX improvements, and automated testing."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop GitHub API Integration Layer",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the integration layer into subtasks for API client setup, endpoint coverage (organizations, repos, activities), rate limit handling, ETag caching, background sync, error mapping, and integration testing. Include subtasks for API schema evolution and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires deep integration with an external API, handling rate limits, caching, background jobs, and robust error handling. The need for both synchronous and asynchronous data flows, plus error recovery and performance considerations, adds significant complexity. Additional subtasks for schema evolution and documentation would improve maintainability."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Backend REST API Endpoints",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the API implementation into subtasks for endpoint scaffolding, authentication middleware, pagination utilities, error response standardization, OpenAPI documentation, integration with business logic, and automated testing for each endpoint.",
      "reasoning": "Designing and implementing a REST API with authentication, pagination, error handling, and documentation is a multi-faceted task. Each endpoint and middleware component introduces branching logic and integration points, increasing cyclomatic complexity. Additional subtasks for error standardization and automated documentation would ensure robustness."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Caching and Performance Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for Redis setup, cache layer abstraction, cache invalidation, background warming, query optimization, API request batching, and telemetry integration. Include subtasks for cache consistency and monitoring.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans infrastructure setup, code changes, and operational monitoring. Implementing effective caching and invalidation, optimizing queries, and adding telemetry each require careful design and testing. Additional subtasks for cache consistency and monitoring would further reduce risk."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Frontend Dashboard Layout and Navigation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the dashboard into subtasks for theme setup, layout scaffolding, navigation logic, Redux store configuration, reusable UI components, responsive design, accessibility, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "While primarily a frontend task, it involves state management, responsive design, accessibility, and integration with backend data. The complexity is moderate due to the need for reusable components and robust navigation, but less than backend integration tasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Organization and Repository Views",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for Redux data fetching, list and detail view components, filtering and sorting logic, skeleton loaders, error handling, responsive design, and integration testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires building multiple data-driven UI components with filtering, sorting, and error handling. The integration with Redux and backend APIs, plus the need for responsive and robust UI, increases complexity. More granular subtasks for testing and UX would be beneficial."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Activity Analytics and Visualizations",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for Chart.js integration, data transformation, timeline and heatmap components, engagement metrics, filtering controls, accessibility, export features, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Building interactive analytics with Chart.js, data aggregation, and accessibility features is moderately complex. The need for responsive, performant, and accessible visualizations, plus data transformation and export, warrants additional subtasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Final Integration and Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for frontend-backend integration, real-time updates, performance optimization, UI polish, analytics, end-to-end testing, security review, deployment readiness, and user acceptance testing.",
      "reasoning": "This is a high-complexity, cross-cutting task involving integration, optimization, security, and testing across the entire stack. Each area (real-time updates, performance, security, UX) is complex on its own, and their combination increases overall risk and effort. More granular subtasks for deployment and user testing are recommended."

      "taskId": 11,
      "taskTitle": "Desktop Application Setup with Tauri",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for Tauri project initialization, SQLite integration, system tray setup, native notifications, secure credential storage, background sync, offline-first architecture, and cross-platform testing.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a cross-platform desktop app with Tauri, local storage, system integration, and offline capabilities is technically demanding. Security, background services, and platform-specific features add to the complexity. Additional subtasks for cross-platform testing and error handling would improve coverage."
