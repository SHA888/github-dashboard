# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Deployment and Distribution Systems
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up deployment pipelines for web mode and distribution systems for desktop applications across platforms.
# Details:
1. Create Docker containerization for web mode
2. Set up PostgreSQL and Redis for web deployment
3. Configure Nginx reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
4. Implement automated backup system
5. Set up monitoring and logging
6. Configure Tauri for cross-platform builds
7. Implement auto-update system for desktop
8. Add crash reporting for desktop mode
9. Create analytics collection (respecting privacy)
10. Set up CI/CD pipelines for both modes

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment in staging environment, verify Docker containers work correctly, test auto-update functionality for desktop apps, verify builds work on all target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), validate SSL configuration.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up containerization and database infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Docker containers for the web application and configure PostgreSQL and Redis for production deployment
### Details:
Create Dockerfiles for the application with proper layering for caching optimization. Set up docker-compose.yml with services for the web app, PostgreSQL, and Redis. Configure volume mounts for persistent data. Implement health checks and proper restart policies. Set up database initialization scripts and migrations. Configure connection pooling and optimize database settings for production workloads.

## 2. Configure web server and security infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS encryption and implement automated backup systems
### Details:
Install and configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to the containerized application. Set up Let's Encrypt for SSL/TLS certificates with auto-renewal. Configure proper HTTP headers for security (HSTS, CSP, etc.). Implement rate limiting and request filtering. Create automated backup scripts for the database using pg_dump with encryption. Set up scheduled backups with rotation policies. Configure off-site backup storage. Test backup and restore procedures.

## 3. Implement monitoring, logging, and analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging systems along with privacy-respecting analytics collection
### Details:
Implement Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. Set up alerting for critical system metrics. Configure centralized logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or similar. Create custom dashboards for application performance monitoring. Implement privacy-focused analytics that anonymizes user data. Set up consent mechanisms for data collection. Create data retention policies compliant with privacy regulations. Configure log rotation and archiving.

## 4. Configure cross-platform desktop builds with Tauri [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Tauri for building desktop applications across platforms with auto-update and crash reporting
### Details:
Install and configure Tauri development environment. Create platform-specific build configurations for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Implement code signing for all platforms. Set up auto-update system using Tauri's update API. Configure update server and release channels (stable, beta). Implement crash reporting with proper symbolication. Create a system for collecting and analyzing crash reports. Test auto-update flows across all supported platforms.

## 5. Establish CI/CD pipelines for web and desktop [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Create comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment of both web and desktop applications
### Details:
Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD system. Create pipeline stages for linting, testing, building, and deploying. Configure caching for faster builds. Set up separate pipelines for web and desktop applications. Implement environment-specific deployments (dev, staging, production). Configure automatic desktop builds for all platforms. Set up release automation with changelogs and version bumping. Implement post-deployment tests and rollback mechanisms. Configure notifications for build and deployment status.
