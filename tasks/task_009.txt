# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Activity Analytics and Visualizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the activity tracking features and data visualizations using Chart.js.
# Details:
Create activity timeline component showing user contributions across repositories. Implement contribution heatmap similar to GitHub's activity graph using Chart.js. Develop repository engagement metrics visualization showing stars, forks, and issues over time. Create issue and PR involvement charts. Implement filtering options for activity data by date range and repository. Add data aggregation for summary statistics. Ensure visualizations are responsive and accessible.

# Test Strategy:
Test chart components with various data scenarios. Verify visualization accuracy against raw data. Test interactive features like tooltips and filters. Ensure charts render correctly across different screen sizes. Validate accessibility of data visualizations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Chart.js Integration and Data Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational Chart.js integration and create a data service to fetch and format activity data for visualizations
### Details:
Implement a reusable Chart.js service that handles common configuration options. Create data fetching services that retrieve user activity data from the API. Implement data transformation utilities to convert raw API data into formats suitable for Chart.js. Set up caching mechanisms for performance optimization. Include error handling for failed data fetches.

## 2. Implement Activity Timeline Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a timeline visualization showing user contributions across repositories over time
### Details:
Develop a horizontal timeline chart using Chart.js line or bar charts. Show contributions categorized by type (commits, PRs, issues, comments). Implement tooltips showing detailed information on hover. Create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. Include animation effects for better user experience. Ensure the component handles empty data states gracefully.

## 3. Build Contribution Heatmap Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a GitHub-style contribution heatmap showing activity frequency and intensity
### Details:
Implement a grid-based heatmap visualization using Chart.js or a compatible plugin. Use color intensity to represent activity levels. Include day and month labels for proper time context. Add tooltips showing exact contribution counts on hover. Ensure the heatmap is responsive and maintains readability at different screen sizes. Implement proper color contrast for accessibility.

## 4. Develop Repository Engagement Metrics Charts [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create visualizations for repository engagement metrics including stars, forks, and issues over time
### Details:
Implement line and/or bar charts showing stars, forks, and issues trends over time. Create a composite chart that overlays multiple metrics for comparison. Add toggle options to show/hide specific metrics. Include annotations for significant events (releases, major updates). Implement zoom functionality for examining specific time periods. Ensure charts have proper legends and axis labels.

## 5. Implement Issue and PR Involvement Charts [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create visualizations showing user involvement in issues and pull requests
### Details:
Develop pie/doughnut charts showing distribution of issues and PRs by status. Create stacked bar charts showing opened vs. closed issues/PRs over time. Implement charts showing average resolution time trends. Add visualizations for PR review activity. Include filtering by repository and issue/PR type. Ensure all charts have consistent styling and proper legends.

## 6. Add Filtering, Aggregation and Accessibility Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Implement filtering controls, data aggregation for summary statistics, and ensure accessibility compliance
### Details:
Create date range picker component for filtering all visualizations. Implement repository selection filters. Add aggregation controls to switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views. Create summary statistics panels showing key metrics. Ensure all charts have proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. Implement high-contrast mode and screen reader compatibility. Add export functionality for charts (PNG, CSV). Ensure all visualizations maintain performance with large datasets.
