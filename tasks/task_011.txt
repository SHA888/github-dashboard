# Task ID: 11
# Title: Desktop Application Setup with Tauri
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Tauri framework and implement core desktop features including local storage, system tray, and native notifications.
# Details:
Initialize Tauri project with React frontend. Set up SQLite database for local storage. Implement system tray integration with quick actions. Add native notification support for repository updates. Configure auto-start capability. Set up secure credential storage for PAT. Implement background sync service. Create offline-first architecture with local data persistence.

# Test Strategy:
Test Tauri build process across platforms. Verify SQLite operations and data persistence. Test system tray functionality and notifications. Validate offline capabilities and sync mechanisms. Ensure secure storage of credentials.
