# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Frontend Dashboard Layout and Navigation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the main dashboard layout, navigation components, and basic UI structure using Material-UI.
# Details:
Set up Material-UI v7 theming with light/dark mode support. Create responsive layout components including AppBar, Drawer, and main content area. Implement navigation between different views (organizations, repositories, activities). Create loading states and error boundaries. Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop. Set up Redux store structure with slices for authentication, organizations, repositories, and activities. Create reusable UI components for cards, lists, and data display.

# Test Strategy:
Create component tests using React Testing Library. Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes. Verify navigation flows work correctly. Test loading states and error handling. Ensure accessibility compliance with WCAG standards.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Material-UI v7 with Theme Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize Material-UI v7 in the project and configure theming with light/dark mode support
### Details:
Install Material-UI v7 packages. Create a theme configuration file with color palettes for both light and dark modes. Implement a ThemeProvider component that wraps the application and provides theme context. Add a theme toggle functionality that persists user preference in local storage. Set up global style overrides and custom typography settings.

## 2. Create Core Layout Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the main responsive layout components that form the dashboard structure
### Details:
Create a responsive AppBar component with app logo, navigation controls, and user profile menu. Implement a collapsible Drawer component with navigation links and proper mobile/desktop behavior. Design a main content area component with appropriate padding and scroll behavior. Ensure all components adapt to the current theme. Add layout context to manage drawer open/close state across components.

## 3. Implement Navigation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Build the navigation infrastructure to handle routing between different dashboard views
### Details:
Set up React Router with route definitions for all main views (organizations, repositories, activities). Create navigation links in the Drawer component that highlight active routes. Implement breadcrumb navigation for nested routes. Add route guards for authenticated routes. Create smooth transitions between routes with loading indicators.

## 4. Set up Redux Store Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Configure Redux store with appropriate slices for state management
### Details:
Initialize Redux store with Redux Toolkit. Create separate slices for authentication, organizations, repositories, and activities with appropriate initial states, reducers, and action creators. Implement selectors for accessing state data. Set up middleware for async operations (Redux Thunk or RTK Query). Connect the Redux store to React components with appropriate hooks.

## 5. Develop Reusable UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.4
### Description: Create a library of reusable UI components for displaying data throughout the dashboard
### Details:
Design and implement card components with consistent styling for different data types. Create list components with sorting and filtering capabilities. Develop data visualization components (charts, graphs) with placeholder data. Build form components with validation. Implement skeleton loaders for content loading states. Create an error boundary component to gracefully handle UI errors.

## 6. Implement Responsive Design and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.5
### Description: Ensure the dashboard works across device sizes and handles errors gracefully
### Details:
Test and refine responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints. Implement media queries for critical UI adjustments. Create mobile-specific navigation patterns (bottom navigation, etc.). Set up comprehensive error boundaries around key dashboard sections. Implement toast notifications for system messages. Add fallback UI states for network errors, empty states, and loading conditions. Conduct cross-browser testing and fix any compatibility issues.
