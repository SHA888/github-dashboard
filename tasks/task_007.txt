# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Desktop-Specific Features
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop Tauri-specific features including offline support, system integration, local data storage, and Logseq integration.
# Details:
1. Set up SQLite for local data storage
2. Implement offline mode with data synchronization
3. Add native system notifications
4. Create system tray integration
5. Implement auto-start capability
6. Develop background synchronization
7. Create Logseq integration (note creation, linking, etc.)
8. Implement local caching strategy
9. Add file system access for exports and backups

# Test Strategy:
Test offline functionality by disconnecting from network, verify data synchronization when reconnecting, test system notifications, validate Logseq integration with different repository types, ensure background sync works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up SQLite Database for Local Storage [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a local SQLite database to store user data for offline access and persistence
### Details:
Create a database schema that mirrors the cloud data structure. Implement database initialization on app startup, connection management, and basic CRUD operations. Include tables for user data, settings, and cached content. Use Tauri's SQLite plugin for database operations and ensure proper error handling and migration support.

## 2. Implement Offline Mode and Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create functionality for the app to work offline and synchronize data when connection is restored
### Details:
Develop a synchronization system that tracks changes made offline and reconciles them with the server when online. Implement conflict resolution strategies, queue pending changes in SQLite, and add network status detection. Create UI indicators for sync status and implement background sync operations. Test thoroughly with various network interruption scenarios.

## 3. Add System Integration Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement native system features including notifications, system tray, and auto-start capability
### Details:
Use Tauri's notification API to implement native system notifications for important events. Create a system tray icon with a context menu for quick actions. Implement auto-start functionality that respects user preferences. Add settings UI for users to configure these system integration features. Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## 4. Develop Background Synchronization Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Create a background service that handles data synchronization even when the app is minimized
### Details:
Implement a background process using Tauri's API that periodically syncs data with the server. Add configurable sync intervals, bandwidth usage controls, and battery-aware syncing. Implement proper locking mechanisms to prevent data corruption during sync. Create logs for sync activities and add the ability to pause/resume background syncing.

## 5. Implement Local Caching Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Develop a comprehensive caching system for improved performance and offline access
### Details:
Create a multi-level caching strategy that includes memory cache for active data and disk cache for persistent storage. Implement cache invalidation policies, TTL for cached items, and prioritization of frequently accessed data. Add cache compression for efficient storage and cache preloading for anticipated user needs. Ensure the cache system handles app updates gracefully.

## 6. Create Logseq Integration and File System Access [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.5
### Description: Implement integration with Logseq for note creation/linking and add file system access for exports/backups
### Details:
Develop an API to interact with Logseq's graph structure. Implement functions to create notes, establish bidirectional links, and query Logseq's knowledge graph. Add file system access capabilities for exporting data to various formats (Markdown, CSV, PDF) and creating/restoring backups. Implement secure file handling with proper permissions and user consent flows. Create a user interface for managing Logseq integration settings and backup operations.
