# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Authentication System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create authentication flows for both web (GitHub OAuth with JWT) and desktop (Personal Access Token) modes with secure token storage.
# Details:
1. Implement GitHub OAuth flow for web mode
2. Create JWT generation and validation for web mode
3. Implement PAT-based authentication for desktop mode
4. Set up secure token storage (browser storage for web, system keychain for desktop)
5. Create login/logout UI components
6. Implement authentication state management with React Query
7. Add rate limiting protection
8. Implement CORS protection for web mode
9. Create authentication error handling

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flows in both modes, verify token storage security, test error scenarios (invalid credentials, expired tokens), ensure rate limiting works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement GitHub OAuth flow for web mode [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the server-side endpoints and client-side logic to handle GitHub OAuth authentication flow for web users
### Details:
Create OAuth endpoints on the backend to handle GitHub authorization requests and callbacks. Implement the client-side redirect to GitHub's authorization page with appropriate scopes. Handle the callback with authorization code exchange for access tokens. Store the GitHub user information and map it to application user accounts.

## 2. Implement JWT generation and validation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create secure JWT token generation after successful GitHub OAuth authentication and implement validation middleware
### Details:
After successful GitHub authentication, generate a JWT containing user information and appropriate claims. Implement signing with a secure secret key. Create middleware to validate JWTs on protected routes. Include token expiration, signature verification, and payload validation. Set up refresh token mechanisms to handle token expiration gracefully.

## 3. Implement PAT-based authentication for desktop mode [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the Personal Access Token authentication flow for desktop application users
### Details:
Implement the backend endpoints to validate GitHub Personal Access Tokens. Create the desktop client authentication flow to prompt users for their GitHub PAT. Verify the token has the required scopes and permissions. Map the authenticated GitHub user to application user accounts similar to the OAuth flow.

## 4. Set up secure token storage mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Implement secure storage for authentication tokens in both web and desktop environments
### Details:
For web: Implement secure browser storage (HttpOnly cookies for JWTs or localStorage with appropriate security measures). For desktop: Integrate with the system keychain (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, libsecret on Linux) to securely store PATs. Implement encryption for any tokens stored outside secure system facilities.

## 5. Create authentication UI components [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.3
### Description: Develop login, logout, and authentication status UI components for both web and desktop interfaces
### Details:
Create React components for login buttons, authentication forms, and user profile displays. Implement logout functionality that properly clears tokens. Design responsive UI elements that work across platforms. Include loading states and error handling in the UI. Create a consistent authentication experience between web and desktop modes.

## 6. Implement authentication state management [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Set up React Query for managing authentication state, user data, and authenticated API requests
### Details:
Create React Query hooks for authentication state management. Implement query invalidation on login/logout. Set up automatic request authentication by adding tokens to API calls. Handle authentication errors and redirect to login when needed. Create protected route components that check authentication status before rendering.

## 7. Implement security protections and error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.6
### Description: Add rate limiting, CORS protection, and comprehensive error handling for authentication flows
### Details:
Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks. Set up proper CORS headers for web mode to prevent cross-site request forgery. Create comprehensive error handling for authentication failures with user-friendly messages. Implement logging for authentication attempts and failures. Add protection against common authentication vulnerabilities like timing attacks.
