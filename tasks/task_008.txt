# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Advanced Analytics and Insights
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive analytics features including contribution patterns, commit history analysis, and detailed repository metrics.
# Details:
1. Create contribution analytics components
2. Implement commit history analysis tools
3. Develop language usage statistics
4. Add issue resolution metrics calculations
5. Implement PR merge rate analysis
6. Create repository growth trend analysis
7. Add code quality metrics (if available via API)
8. Implement user activity patterns
9. Create exportable reports for analytics data

# Test Strategy:
Validate analytics calculations against GitHub data, test with repositories of different sizes and activity levels, verify export functionality, test performance with large data sets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Analytics Data Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation for analytics by implementing data collection services that gather repository metrics, commit history, and user contributions from the GitHub API.
### Details:
Develop a service layer that fetches and caches analytics data from GitHub's API. Implement data models for storing contribution data, commit history, and repository metrics. Create utility functions to process and transform raw API data into structured formats suitable for visualization. Include error handling and rate limit management for API requests.

## 2. Develop Contribution and Commit Analysis Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build UI components to visualize contribution patterns and commit history analysis, including commit frequency, contributor distribution, and code change patterns.
### Details:
Create reusable chart components (line charts, bar charts, heat maps) for visualizing contribution data. Implement filters for time periods and contributors. Build commit history timeline visualization with detailed commit information on hover/click. Add metrics for commit frequency by day/week/month and contributor distribution charts. Ensure components are responsive and accessible.

## 3. Implement Repository and Code Metrics Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create components for repository metrics and code analysis, including language usage statistics, repository growth trends, and code quality metrics if available via API.
### Details:
Develop language usage pie/bar charts showing distribution of programming languages in the repository. Implement repository growth visualization showing additions/deletions over time. Create code quality metric displays if available through GitHub API or integrations. Add repository size tracking and visualization of growth patterns. Include tooltips and explanations for each metric.

## 4. Add Issue and Pull Request Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement analytics for issue resolution metrics and PR merge rate analysis, showing team performance and project velocity.
### Details:
Create components to visualize issue resolution time, categorized by labels or assignees. Implement PR merge rate analysis showing acceptance rates and review times. Add visualizations for open vs. closed issues over time. Include filtering capabilities by assignee, label, and time period. Develop metrics for team velocity and bottleneck identification in the development process.

## 5. Create Exportable Reports and Dashboard Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Implement a unified analytics dashboard with exportable reports, integrating all previously developed analytics components into a cohesive user interface.
### Details:
Develop a dashboard layout with configurable widgets for different analytics components. Implement report generation functionality with options to export as PDF, CSV, or image formats. Create user preference storage to remember dashboard configuration. Add print-friendly views for reports. Implement sharing capabilities for reports via URL or direct download. Ensure the dashboard is responsive and performs well with large datasets.
