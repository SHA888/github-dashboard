# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Data Visualization Components
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create reusable chart and graph components using Chart.js to visualize repository metrics, contribution data, and other analytics.
# Details:
1. Set up Chart.js integration with React
2. Create language distribution pie charts
3. Implement contribution graph components
4. Build code frequency line charts
5. Create activity heatmaps
6. Implement repository growth trend charts
7. Add PR merge rate visualizations
8. Create issue resolution metrics charts
9. Ensure all charts are responsive and support dark/light themes

# Test Strategy:
Test charts with various data sets, verify correct rendering in different screen sizes, check theme compatibility, ensure accessibility compliance, test chart interactions and tooltips.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Chart.js integration with React [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundation for all visualization components by integrating Chart.js with the React application
### Details:
Install Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 packages. Create a base ChartWrapper component that handles common functionality like responsiveness, theme support (dark/light), and loading states. Implement utility functions for color schemes, data formatting, and chart configuration options that will be reused across all chart types.

## 2. Implement repository overview visualizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create the core visualization components for repository statistics
### Details:
Develop two key visualization components: (1) A language distribution pie chart showing the breakdown of programming languages used in the repository, and (2) Repository growth trend charts showing commits, additions, and deletions over time. Ensure both components use the ChartWrapper and follow consistent styling. Include options for time period filtering (last week, month, year) and implement proper data formatting for each chart type.

## 3. Build contribution and activity visualizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create visualizations that show developer contributions and activity patterns
### Details:
Implement three visualization components: (1) Contribution graph showing individual developer contributions over time, (2) Activity heatmap displaying when contributions occur (by day/hour), and (3) Code frequency line charts showing additions and deletions. Include filtering options by contributor and time period. Ensure all charts handle empty data gracefully and provide meaningful tooltips for data points.

## 4. Develop PR and issue metrics visualizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create visualizations for pull request and issue-related metrics
### Details:
Implement two visualization components: (1) PR merge rate charts showing the ratio of merged vs. closed PRs over time, and (2) Issue resolution metrics charts displaying open/closed issues, average resolution time, and issue categories. Include interactive elements like clickable data points that navigate to the corresponding PR or issue. Add filtering capabilities by labels, assignees, and time periods.

## 5. Optimize and finalize all visualization components [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Ensure all charts are performant, accessible, and properly integrated with the application's state management
### Details:
Implement data caching strategies to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Add animation options for chart transitions. Ensure all charts are accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. Create comprehensive documentation for each chart component including props, usage examples, and customization options. Implement unit and integration tests for all visualization components. Optimize bundle size by ensuring proper code splitting for chart components.
