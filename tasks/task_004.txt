# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop GitHub API Integration Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the integration with GitHub API using octocrab, focusing on fetching organization and repository data.
# Details:
Create a GitHub service module in the Rust backend using octocrab. Implement functions to fetch user organizations, organization details, repositories, and user activities. Handle GitHub API rate limits with proper headers and backoff strategies. Implement conditional requests using ETags to minimize API usage. Create background jobs for data synchronization to avoid blocking user requests. Implement error handling for API failures.

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests with GitHub API mocks. Test rate limit handling with simulated limits. Verify conditional requests reduce API calls. Test error recovery scenarios. Measure performance under various load conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create GitHub service module with basic authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundation for GitHub API integration by creating a service module that handles authentication and basic client setup using octocrab
### Details:
Create a new module `github_service.rs` in the backend. Implement a struct `GitHubService` that wraps the octocrab client. Add configuration for GitHub API credentials (OAuth tokens). Implement initialization with proper error handling. Create a basic test to verify authentication works correctly. Document the module's public interface.

## 2. Implement organization and repository data fetching [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add methods to fetch user organizations, organization details, and repositories from GitHub API
### Details:
Extend the GitHubService to add methods for: 1) fetching user's organizations, 2) getting detailed information about a specific organization, 3) listing repositories for an organization, and 4) getting repository details. Implement proper pagination handling for list endpoints. Create appropriate data structures to represent the GitHub entities in your application. Add unit tests for each new method.

## 3. Implement API rate limit handling and conditional requests [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Add support for handling GitHub API rate limits and implement conditional requests using ETags
### Details:
Extend the GitHubService to track and respect rate limits by parsing GitHub API headers. Implement exponential backoff when approaching rate limits. Add a caching layer to store ETags for responses. Modify API request methods to include ETags in conditional requests. Create a mechanism to check if data has changed before processing. Add logging for rate limit information. Write tests to verify the rate limiting and ETag functionality.

## 4. Create background jobs for data synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement a background job system to synchronize GitHub data without blocking user requests
### Details:
Create a job scheduler for GitHub data synchronization. Implement jobs for: 1) syncing organization data, 2) syncing repository data, and 3) syncing user activity data. Add configuration for job frequency and timeout settings. Implement proper error handling and retry logic for failed jobs. Create a mechanism to queue synchronization requests from the frontend. Add metrics to track job performance and success rates. Write tests for the background job system.

## 5. Implement comprehensive error handling and service integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Add robust error handling for all GitHub API interactions and integrate the service with the rest of the application
### Details:
Create a custom error type for GitHub API errors. Map octocrab errors to application-specific errors with meaningful messages. Implement recovery strategies for common failure scenarios. Add detailed logging for troubleshooting. Create API endpoints in your application that expose the GitHub data to the frontend. Document all error cases and how they're handled. Write integration tests that verify the complete flow from API request to response. Add metrics to track API success rates and performance.
