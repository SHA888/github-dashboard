# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Caching and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Redis caching for frequently accessed data and implement performance optimizations for API requests.
# Details:
Implement Redis caching for GitHub API responses with appropriate TTL values. Cache organization and repository lists with a 1-hour expiration. Cache individual repository details with a 3-hour expiration. Implement cache invalidation strategies for data updates. Add background jobs for cache warming. Optimize database queries using indexes and query analysis. Implement request batching for GitHub API calls. Add telemetry for performance monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Measure API response times with and without caching. Test cache hit/miss scenarios. Verify cache invalidation works correctly. Load test the system to ensure performance under high load. Validate that background jobs correctly update cache data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Redis infrastructure and basic caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Redis for the application and implement the core caching infrastructure
### Details:
Install and configure Redis server. Create a caching service class that handles connection to Redis, basic get/set operations with TTL, and cache key generation. Implement error handling for Redis connection issues. Create configuration for different cache TTLs based on data types. Write unit tests for the caching service.

## 2. Implement GitHub API response caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Cache responses from GitHub API with appropriate TTL values
### Details:
Modify the GitHub API service to use the caching layer. Implement caching for organization lists with 1-hour TTL. Implement caching for repository lists with 1-hour TTL. Implement caching for individual repository details with 3-hour TTL. Add cache headers to responses. Create cache key strategy based on request parameters and authentication context.

## 3. Develop cache invalidation and warming strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement mechanisms to invalidate stale cache and proactively warm the cache
### Details:
Create cache invalidation hooks for data updates (e.g., webhook events from GitHub). Implement selective cache invalidation to only clear affected entries. Create a background job system using a task queue (like Bull). Implement cache warming jobs that pre-fetch commonly accessed data. Schedule cache warming jobs to run periodically. Add logging for cache hits, misses, and invalidations.

## 4. Optimize database queries and GitHub API requests [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Improve database performance and optimize external API usage
### Details:
Analyze and optimize database queries using EXPLAIN. Add appropriate indexes to database tables based on query patterns. Implement query result caching where appropriate. Create a request batching mechanism for GitHub API calls to reduce API rate limit usage. Implement request deduplication to prevent redundant API calls. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests.

## 5. Implement performance monitoring and telemetry [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Add instrumentation to track and analyze application performance
### Details:
Integrate an APM (Application Performance Monitoring) solution. Add request timing metrics for API endpoints. Implement cache performance metrics (hit rate, latency). Create custom dashboards for monitoring cache and API performance. Set up alerts for performance degradation. Add tracing for request flows through the system. Document performance optimization strategies and results.
