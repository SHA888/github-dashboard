# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Web-Specific Features
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop features specific to the web mode including real-time updates via WebSocket, live notifications, and shared dashboards.
# Details:
1. Set up WebSocket connection for real-time updates
2. Implement live notification system
3. Create dynamic data refresh mechanism
4. Develop shared dashboard functionality
5. Implement team collaboration tools
6. Add API rate limit pooling
7. Create webhook support for external integrations
8. Implement multi-device session management
9. Add server-side caching with Redis

# Test Strategy:
Test WebSocket connections for reliability, verify real-time updates appear correctly, test notification delivery, validate shared dashboard functionality across multiple users, test rate limit handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up WebSocket infrastructure [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the WebSocket connection between client and server to enable real-time communication
### Details:
Implement WebSocket server using Socket.io or a similar library. Create connection handling for client authentication, connection management, and basic message passing. Include error handling, reconnection logic, and connection status indicators in the UI. Test with simple ping/pong messages to verify connectivity.

## 2. Implement real-time data refresh mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a system to push data updates to connected clients when data changes on the server
### Details:
Build on the WebSocket infrastructure to implement data channels for different types of updates. Create a publisher/subscriber pattern where clients can subscribe to specific data channels. Implement server-side logic to detect data changes and broadcast updates to relevant subscribers. Add client-side handlers to process incoming data and update the UI accordingly without page refreshes.

## 3. Develop live notification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create a notification system that alerts users of important events in real-time
### Details:
Design and implement a notification data structure with types (info, warning, error), content, timestamp, and read status. Create server-side logic to generate notifications based on system events. Use the WebSocket connection to deliver notifications to relevant users. Implement a notification center UI component with counters, notification list, and the ability to mark notifications as read. Add browser notifications support with permission handling.

## 4. Create shared dashboard functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement dashboards that can be viewed and interacted with by multiple users simultaneously
### Details:
Design a dashboard data model that supports sharing permissions and tracks viewers. Implement server-side logic for dashboard access control and change tracking. Use the real-time update mechanism to synchronize dashboard state across all connected viewers. Create UI components to show who is currently viewing the dashboard and highlight changes made by others. Implement conflict resolution for simultaneous edits.

## 5. Add Redis-based caching and session management [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.4
### Description: Implement server-side caching with Redis to improve performance and manage multi-device sessions
### Details:
Set up Redis integration for the application. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce database load. Create a session management system that tracks user sessions across multiple devices. Use Redis to store session data and WebSocket connection information. Implement logic to synchronize user state across devices and handle session expiration. Add UI indicators to show when a user is logged in on multiple devices.
